                        <h4>Context:</h4><p>The treaty formally concluded the global conflict between Great Britain and France. Britain emerged as the world's dominant colonial power, having expelled France from North America.</p>

                        <h4>Context:</h4><p>As a direct measure to raise revenue for the defense of the colonies, Parliament passed the Stamp Act, requiring a tax stamp on all legal documents, newspapers, and pamphlets.</p>
                        <h4>Significance:</h4><p>This was the first *direct* tax levied on the colonists. They responded with the cry of "no taxation without representation," arguing that as they had no representatives in Parliament, the body had no right to tax them directly. Resistance was fierce, culminating in the Stamp Act Congress.</p>

                    <p>The famous Patriot slogan, "No taxation without representation," only scratches the surface. At its core, the crisis was a struggle over sovereignty. Colonists, believing they possessed the full "rights of Englishmen," saw parliamentary taxation as a violation of their constitutional right to be taxed only by their own elected representatives. The British government, operating under a theory of "virtual representation," viewed the taxes as a just and necessary way for America to contribute to the cost of its own defense after the costly Seven Years' War.</p>

                    <h3>A War of Posts and Preservation</h3>
                    <p>The military contest was one of asymmetry. The British possessed a professional army and a dominant navy, aiming to capture major cities and win a decisive battle. The Americans, under George Washington, had to create an army from scratch. Recognizing he could not consistently win head-on, Washington adopted a "Fabian" strategy of attrition. His goal was to preserve the Continental Army as a fighting force and symbol of the revolution, fighting only when conditions were favorable and wearing down the British will to continue the fight.</p>

                    <h3>The World Turned Upside Down: Global Diplomacy</h3>
                    <p>The Revolution was won as much in European courts as on American battlefields. From the outset, Congress sought foreign aid. The American victory at Saratoga convinced France, Britain's traditional rival, that the cause was viable. The 1778 Franco-American Alliance internationalized the conflict, providing the U.S. with money, equipment, and most critically, the naval power that would prove decisive at Yorktown. When Spain also declared war on Britain, British resources were stretched thin, making victory in America increasingly unlikely.</p>

                    <h3>Many Wars in One: Diverse Experiences</h3>
                    <p>The Revolution was not monolithic. For <strong>women</strong>, it brought new roles managing farms and businesses and direct participation in the war effort, fostering a new political awareness. For <strong>Native Americans</strong>, it was a disaster. Most allied with the British, seeing them as a lesser threat to their lands. The American victory unleashed a flood of westward expansion that led to their accelerated dispossession. For <strong>African Americans</strong>, the war was a paradox. Thousands sought freedom with the British, while thousands more fought for the Patriot cause. The Revolution's rhetoric of liberty fueled the early abolitionist movement but left the institution of slavery intact in the South, setting the stage for future conflict.</p>

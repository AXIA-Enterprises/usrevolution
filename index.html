                <p><strong>British Justifications:</strong> British officials defended taxation through "virtual representation" theory - that Parliament represented all British subjects regardless of direct electoral participation. </p>

                <p><strong>Economic Reality:</strong> The actual tax burden was minimal - colonists paid only 1 shilling annually compared to 26 shillings for British residents.  This reveals the debate was fundamentally about political power, not economic hardship. </p>

                <p><strong>American Strategy Evolution:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Early Phase (1775-1776):</strong> Reliance on militia, conventional European tactics</li>
                    <li><strong>Middle Phase (1777-1778):</strong> Development of Continental Army, strategic retreats, Fabian strategy</li>
                    <li><strong>Later Phase (1779-1781):</strong> Combined conventional/guerrilla warfare, coordination with French allies</li>

                <h2 class="theme-title">International Diplomacy and Alliances</h2>
                <p><strong>Global Transformation:</strong> The American Revolution transformed from a colonial rebellion into the first successful war of independence in modern history, establishing precedents that influenced liberation movements worldwide. </p>

                <p><strong>French Alliance:</strong> The Franco-American Alliance of 1778 was crucial, providing military support, naval power, and legitimacy. French involvement escalated the conflict into a global war against Britain. </p>

                <p><strong>Spanish and Dutch Support:</strong> Spain provided aid through New Orleans and launched Gulf Coast campaigns.  The Netherlands became the second European power to recognize U.S. independence and provided crucial loans. </p>

            <div class="theme-section">
                <h2 class="theme-title">Economic Factors and Social Changes</h2>
                <p><strong>Class-Based Impact:</strong> The Revolution affected different social classes differently:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Elite merchants and planters:</strong> Some supported revolution to escape British restrictions; others remained loyal due to business connections</li>
                    <li><strong>Middle classes:</strong> Artisans and small farmers often benefited from domestic production increases</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor and working classes:</strong> Hit hardest by economic disruption but gained some opportunities through military service </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Diverse Experiences:</strong> Women gained some political roles through boycotts and resistance activities.  African Americans faced a paradox - some gained freedom through military service, while others saw slavery systems reinforced.  Native Americans experienced catastrophic land loss and cultural disruption. </p>
